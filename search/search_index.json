Index Invocation Core Script pihole Web Script pihole -a Pi-hole Core \u00b6 Feature Invocation Core pihole Whitelisting, Blacklisting and Regex pihole -w , pihole -b , pihole -regex , pihole -wild Debugger pihole debug Log Flush pihole flush Reconfigure pihole reconfigure Tail pihole tail Admin pihole -a Chronometer pihole chronometer Gravity pihole updateGravity Logging pihole logging Query pihole query Update pihole updatePihole Version pihole version Uninstall pihole uninstall Status pihole status Enable & Disable pihole enable Restart DNS pihole restartdns Checkout pihole checkout Core Script \u00b6 Help Command pihole --help Script Location /usr/local/bin/pihole Example Usage pihole -b advertiser.example.com The core script of Pi-hole provides the ability to tie many DNS related functions into a simple and user-friendly management system, so that one may easily block unwanted content such as advertisements. For both the Command-line Interface (CLI) and Web Interface, we achieve this through the pihole command (this helps minimize code duplication, and allows users to read exactly what's happening using bash scripting). This \"wrapper\" elevates the current user (whether it be your own user account, or www-data ) using sudo , but restricts the elevation to solely what can be called through the wrapper. Whitelisting, Blacklisting and Regex \u00b6 Help Command pihole -w --help , pihole -b --help , pihole -regex --help , pihole -wild --help Script Location /opt/pihole/list.sh Example Usage pihole -regex '^example.com$' '.*\\.example2.net' Administrators need to be able to manually add and remove domains for various purposes, and these commands serve that purpose. See Regex Blocking for more information about using Regex. Basic Script Process : Each domain is validated using regex (except when using -regex ), to ensure invalid domains and IDNs are not added A whitelisted domain gets added or removed from /etc/pihole/whitelist.txt A blacklisted domain gets added or removed from /etc/pihole/blacklist.txt On either list type, gravity.sh is then called to consolidate an updated copy of gravity.list , and the DNS server is reloaded A regex blacklisted domain gets added or removed from /etc/pihole/regex.list A wildcard domain gets converted into regex and added or removed from /etc/pihole/regex.list For both regex-based commands, gravity.sh is then called to restart the DNS server Debugger \u00b6 Help Command N/A Script Location /opt/pihole/piholeDebug.sh Example Usage pihole debug The Pi-hole debugger will attempt to diagnose any issues, and link to an FAQ with instructions as to how an admin can rectify the issue. Once the debugger has finished, the admin has the option to upload the generated log to the Pi-hole developers, who can help with diagnosing and rectifying persistent issues. Log Flush \u00b6 Help Command N/A Script Location /opt/pihole/piholeLogFlush.sh Example Usage pihole flush When invoked manually, this command will allow you to empty Pi-hole's log, which is located at /var/log/pihole.log . The command also serves to rotate the log daily, if the logrotate application is installed. Reconfigure \u00b6 Help Command N/A Script Location /etc/.pihole/automated install/basic-install.sh Example Usage pihole reconfigure There are times where the administrator will need to repair or reconfigure the Pi-hole installation, which is performed via this command. Basic Script Process : basic-install.sh will be run Reconfigure will run through the first-time installation prompts, asking for upstream DNS provider, IP protocols, etc Repair will retain your existing settings and will attempt to repair any scripts or dependencies as necessary The rest of basic-install.sh will then run as appropriate Tail \u00b6 Help Command N/A Script Location /usr/local/bin/pihole Example Usage pihole tail Since Pi-hole will log DNS queries by default, using this command to watch the log in real-time can be useful for debugging a problematic site, or even just for sheer curiosities sake. Admin \u00b6 Help Command pihole -a --help Script Location /opt/pihole/webpage.sh Example Usage pihole -a -p secretpassword Detailed information on this is found here . Chronometer \u00b6 Help Command pihole -c --help Script Location /opt/pihole/chronometer.sh Example Usage pihole -c -e Chronometer is a console dashboard of real-time stats, which can be displayed via ssh or on an LCD screen attached directly to your hardware.

Image courtesy of /u/super_nicktendo22 Gravity \u00b6 Help Command N/A Script Location /opt/pihole/gravity.sh Example Usage pihole -g Gravity is one of the most important scripts of Pi-hole. Its main purpose is to retrieve blocklists, and then consolidate them into one unique list for the built-in DNS server to use, but it also serves to complete the process of manual whitelisting, blacklisting and wildcard update. It is run automatically each week, but it can be invoked manually at any time. Basic Script Process : It will determine Internet connectivity, and give time for dnsmasq to be resolvable on low-end systems if has just been restarted It extracts all URLs and domains from /etc/pihole/adlists.list It runs through each URL, downloading it if necessary curl checks the servers Last-Modified header to ensure it is getting a newer version It will attempt to parse the file into a domains-only format if necessary Lists are merged, comments removed, sorted uniquely and stored as list.preEventHorizon Whitelisted entries within /etc/pihole/whitelist.txt are removed from list.preEventHorizon and saved into a temporary file Blacklisted, \"localhost\" and temporary file entries are added as separate .list files Gravity cleans up temporary content and reloads the DNS server Logging \u00b6 Help Command pihole logging --help Script Location /usr/local/bin/pihole Example Usage pihole logging off This command specifies whether the Pi-hole log should be used, by commenting out log-queries within /etc/dnsmasq.d/01-pihole.conf and flushing the log. Query \u00b6 Help Command pihole query --help Script Location /usr/local/bin/pihole Example Usage pihole -q -exact -adlist example.domain.com This command will query your whitelist, blacklist, wildcards and adlists for a specified domain. Basic Script Process : User-specified options are handled Using idn , it will convert Internationalized domain names into punycode The whitelist and the blacklist are searched The possible wildcard matches are then searched ( /etc/dnsmasq.d/03-pihole-wildcard.conf ) The adlists are then searched ( /etc/pihole/list.*.domains ) Output is determined by the specified options, ensuring that a file name is only printed once Update \u00b6 Help Command pihole update Script Location /opt/pihole/update.sh Example Usage pihole -up Check Pi-hole Core, Web Interface and FTL repositories to determine what upgrades (if any) are required. It will then automatically update and reinstall if necessary. Basic Script Process : Script determines if updates are available by querying GitHub Updated files are downloaded to the local filesystem using git basic-install.sh is run Version \u00b6 Help Command pihole version Script Location /opt/pihole/version.sh Example Usage pihole -v -c Shows installed versions of Pi-hole, Web Interface & FTL. It also provides options to configure which details will be printed, such as the current version, latest version, hash and subsystem. Uninstall \u00b6 Help Command N/A Script Location /etc/.pihole/automated install/uninstall.sh Example Usage pihole uninstall Uninstall Pi-hole from your system, giving the option to remove each dependency individually.

This document details why Docker Pi-hole DHCP is different from normal Pi-hole and how to fix the problem. Technical details \u00b6 Docker's bridge network mode is default and recommended as a more secure setting for containers because docker is all about isolation, they isolate processes by default and the bridge network isolates the networking by default too. You gain access to the isolated container's service ports by using port forwards in your container's runtime config; for example -p 67:67 is DHCP. However, DHCP protocol operates through a network 'broadcast' which cannot span multiple networks (docker's bridge, and your LAN network). In order to get DHCP on to your network there are a few approaches: Working network modes \u00b6 Here are details on setting up DHCP for Docker Pi-hole for various network modes available in docker. Docker Pi-hole with host networking mode \u00b6 Advantages : Simple, easy, and fast setup Possibly the simplest way to get DHCP working with Docker Pi-hole is to use host networking which makes the container be on your LAN Network like a regular Raspberry Pi-hole would be, allowing it to broadcast DHCP. It will have the same IP as your Docker host server in this mode so you may still have to deal with port conflicts. Inside your docker-compose.yml remove all ports and replace them with: network_mode: host docker run --net=host if you don't use docker-compose Docker Pi-hole with a Macvlan network \u00b6 Advantages : Works well with NAS devices or hard port conflicts A Macvlan network is the most advanced option since it requires more network knowledge and setup. This mode is similar to host network mode but instead of borrowing the IP of your docker host computer it grabs a new IP address off your LAN network. Having the container get its own IP not only solves the broadcast problem but avoids port conflicts you might have on devices such as NAS devices with web interfaces. Tony Lawrence detailed macvlan setup for Pi-hole first in the second part of his great blog series about Running Pi-hole on Synology Docker , check it out here: Free your Synology ports with Macvlan Docker Pi-hole with a bridge networking \u00b6 Advantages : Works well with container web reverse proxies like Nginx or Traefik If you want to use docker's bridged network mode then you need to run a DHCP relay. A relay points to your containers forwarded port 67 and spreads the broadcast signal from an isolated docker bridge onto your LAN network. Relays are very simple software, you just have to configure it to point to your Docker host's IP port 67. Although uncommon, if your router is an advanced enough router it may support a DHCP relay. Try googling for your router manufacturer + DHCP relay or looking in your router's configuration around the DHCP settings or advanced areas. If your router doesn't support it, you can run a software/container based DHCP relay on your LAN instead. The author of dnsmasq made a very tiny simple one called DHCP-helper . DerFetzer kindly shared his great setup of a DHCP-helper container on the Pi-hole Discourse forums. Warning about the Default bridge network \u00b6 The out of the box default bridge network has some limitations that a user created bridge network won't have. These limitations make it painful to use especially when connecting multiple containers together. Avoid using the built-in default docker bridge network, the simplest way to do this is just use a docker-compose setup since it creates its own network automatically. If compose isn't an option the bridge network docs should help you create your own.","title":"DHCP"},{"location":"docker/DHCP/#docker-dhcp-and-network-modes","text":"Docker runs in a separate network by default called a docker bridge network, which makes DHCP want to serve addresses to that network and not your LAN network where you probably want it.

DerFetzer kindly shared his great setup of a DHCP-helper container on the Pi-hole Discourse forums.","title":"Docker Pi-hole with a bridge networking"},{"location":"docker/DHCP/#warning-about-the-default-bridge-network","text":"The out of the box default bridge network has some limitations that a user created bridge network won't have.

In contrast to many other database management solutions, FTL DNS does not need a server database engine as the database engine is directly embedded in FTL DNS . It seems an obvious choice as it is probably the most widely deployed database engine - it is used today by several widespread web browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems (such as mobile phones), among others. Hence, it is rich in supported platforms and offered features. SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL and can be used for high-level queries. We update the database file periodically and on exit of FTL DNS (triggered e.g. by a service pihole-FTL restart ). The updating frequency can be controlled by the parameter DBINTERVAL and defaults to once per minute. We think this interval is sufficient to protect against data losses due to power failure events. FTL DNS needs the database to populate its internal history of the most recent 24 hours. If the database is disabled, FTL DNS will show an empty query history after a restart. The location of the database can be configured by the config parameter DBFILE . It defaults to /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db . If the given file does not exist, FTL DNS will create a new (empty) database file. Another way of controlling the size of the long-term database is setting a maximum age for log queries to keep using the config parameter MAXDBDAYS . It defaults to 365 days, i.e. queries that are older than one year get periodically removed to limit the growth of the long-term database file. The config parameter DBIMPORT controls whether FTL loads information from the database on startup. It needs to do this to populate the internal data structure with the most recent history. However, as importing from the database on disk can delay FTL on very large deploys, it can be disabled using this option. Split database \u00b6 You can split your long-term database by periodically rotating the database file (do this only when pihole-FTL is not running). The individual database contents can easily be merged when required. This could be implemented by running a monthly cron job such as: sudo service pihole-FTL stop sudo mv /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db /media/backup/pihole-FTL_ $( date + \"%m-%y\" ) .db sudo service pihole-FTL start Note that DNS resolution will not be available as long as pihole-FTL is stopped.

However, it is important to understand that we are not moving away from dnsmasq , but, in contrast, are coupling even closer to it by incorporating it into FTL . This provides us with a much more reliable monolith DNS solution where we can be sure that the versions of FTL and the DNS internals are always 100% compatible with each other. As we maintain our own fork of dnsmasq we have been able to apply some minimal changes to the source code which might bring substantial benefits for our users. However, although the potential for changes is endless, we want to include as few modifications as possible. As a purely volunteer-driven project, you will surely understand that it was already a major undertaking to get FTL DNS set up and running. It was much more than just copy-pasting dnsmasq into place. We have always been very explicit about how we will react to feature requests that target the resolver part (from the initial FTL DNS beta test announcement): Think of FTL DNS as dnsmasq with Pi-hole\u2019s special sauce. This allows us to easily merge any upstream changes that get added, while still allowing us to continue to develop Pi-hole as we have been. If we would start to modify the resolver code in too many places, then this would probably make us deviate too much from dnsmasq 's code base and we couldn't apply patches easily preventing us from being able to ship important security updates. Implemented modifications in dnsmasq 's source code \u00b6 FTL hooks \u00b6 We place hooks in a lot of places in the resolver that branch out into FTL code to process queries and responses. By this, we keep the resolver code itself clean. Remove limit on maximum cache size \u00b6 Users can configure the size of the resolver's name cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the cache size to zero disables caching. We think users should be allowed to set the cache size to any value they find appropriate. However, dnsmasq 's source code contains a condition that limits the maximum size of the cache to 10,000 names. We removed this hard-coded upper limit in option.c and submitted a patch to remove this hard-coded limit in the upstream version of dnsmasq . Improve detection algorithm for determining the \"best\" forward destination \u00b6 The DNS forward destination determination algorithm in FTL DNS 's is modified to be much less restrictive than the original algorithm in dnsmasq . We keep using the fastest responding server now for 1000 queries or 10 minutes (whatever happens earlier) instead of 50 queries or 10 seconds (default values in dnsmasq ). We keep the exceptions, i.e., we try all possible forward destinations if SERVFAIL or REFUSED is received or if a timeout occurs. Overall, this change has proven to greatly reduce the number of actually performed queries in typical Pi-hole environments. It may even be understood as being preferential in terms of privacy (as we send queries much less often to all servers).

Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process's credentials (user and group permissions and supplementary process capabilities).

This may come in handy if you are designing blocking rules (see also our cheat sheet below!). In our implementation, all characters match themselves except for the following special characters: .[{}()\\*+?|^$ . If you want to match those, you need to escape them like \\. for a literal period, but no rule without exception (see character groups below for further details). Anchors ( ^ and $ ) \u00b6 First of all, we look at anchors that can be used to indicate the start or the end of a domain, respectively. If you don't specify anchors, the match may be partial (see examples below). Example Interpretation domain partial match . Without anchors, a text may appear anywhere in the domain. This matches some.domain.com , domain.com and verylongdomain.com and more ^localhost$ exact match matching only localhost but neither a.localhost nor localhost.com ^abc matches any domain starting ( ^ ) in \"abc\" like abcdomain.com , abc.domain.com but not def.abc.com com$ matches any domain ending ( $ ) in \"com\" such as domain.com but not domain.com.co.uk Wildcard ( . ) \u00b6 An unescaped period stands for any single character. Example Interpretation ^domain.$ matches domaina , domainb , domainc , but not domain Bounds and multipliers ( {} , * , + , and ? ) \u00b6 With bounds, one can denote the number of times something has to occur: Bound Meaning ab{4} matches a domain that contains a single a followed by four b (matching only abbbb ) ab{4,} matches a domain that contains a single a followed by at least four b (matching also abbbbbbbb ) ab{3,5} matches a domain that contains a single a followed by three to five b (matching only abbb , abbbb , and abbbbb ) Multipliers are shortcuts for some of the bounds that are needed most often: Multipliers Bounds equivalent Meaning ? {0,1} never or once (optional) * {0,} never or more (optional) + {1,} once or more (mandatory) To illustrate the usefulness of multipliers (and bounds), we provide a few examples: Example Interpretation ^r-*movie matches a domain like r------movie.com where the number of dashes can be arbitrary (also none) ^r-?movie matches only the domains rmovie.com and r-movie.com but not those with more than one dash ^r-+movie matches only the domains with at least one dash, i.e., not rmovie.com ^a?b+ matches domains like abbbb.com (zero or one a at the beginning followed by one or more b ) Character groups ( [] ) \u00b6 With character groups, a set of characters can be matched: Character group Interpretation [abc] matches a , b , or c (using explicitly specified characters) [a-c] matches a , b , or c (using a range ) [a-c]+ matches any non-zero number of a , b , c [a-z] matches any single lowercase letter [a-zA-Z] matches any single letter [a-z0-9] matches any single lowercase letter or any single digit [^a-z] Negation matching any single character except lowercase letters abc[0-9]+ matches the string abc followed by a number of arbitrary length Bracket expressions are an exception to the character escape rule. Inside them, all special characters, including the backslash ( \\ ), lose their special powers, i.e. they match themselves exactly. Furthermore, to include a literal ] in the list, make it the first character (like []] or [^]] if negated). To include a literal - , make it the first or last character, or the second endpoint of a range (e.g. [a-z-] to match a to z and - ). Groups ( () ) \u00b6 Using groups, we can enclose regular expressions, they are most powerful when combined with bounds or multipliers (see also alternations below). Example Interpretation (abc) matches abc (trivial example) (abc)* matches zero or more copies of abc like abcabc but not abcdefabc (abc){1,3} matches one, two or three copies of abc : abc , abcabc , abcabcabc but nothing else Alternations ( | ) \u00b6 Alternations can be used as an \"or\" operator in regular expressions. Example Interpretation (abc)|(def) matches abc and def domain(a|b)\\.com matches domaina.com and domainb.com but not domain.com or domainx.com domain(a|b)*\\.com matches domain.com , domainaaaa.com domainbbb.com but not domainab.com (any number of a or b in between domain and .com ) Character classes ( [:class:] ) \u00b6 In addition to character groups, there are also some special character classes available, such as Character class Group equivalent Interpretation [:digit:] [0-9] matches digits [:lower:] [a-z] matched lowercase letters [:upper:] [A-Z] matched uppercase letters [:alpha:] [A-Za-z] matches alphabetic characters [:alnum:] [A-Za-z0-9] matches alphabetic characters and digits Advanced examples \u00b6 After going through our quick tutorial, we provide some more advanced examples so you can test your knowledge. Block domain with only numbers \u00b6 ^[0-9][^a-z]+\\.((com)|(edu))$ Blocks domains containing only numbers (no letters) and ending in .com or .edu .

As the domains in the long-term database reflect your particular real-life usage, a benchmark on these domains should give you a good feeling for the performance of your Pi-hole. 1. Extract the domains from the long-term database \u00b6 You can extract the domains using, e.g., sqlite3 /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db \"SELECT domain FROM queries LIMIT 100000;\" > domains.list This will generate a list file with up to 100,000 domains. You can increase the upper limit of domains, however, we suggest starting from a small number of domains to get realistic results in a reasonable period of time. They are extracted into the list file as they are recorded in the database. There will be lots of frequently queried domains (maybe google.com or similar) as well as some blocked ad domains. This list will serve you as an individualized testing bench for realistic DNS queries as typically seen in your particular environment . 2. Optimize Pi-hole setting for benchmarking \u00b6 2.1 Disable logging \u00b6 We suggest disabling both logging and the long-term database during the benchmark run as both the log file and the database would otherwise unnecessarily grow, several hundred megabytes may be possible. Not only would your statistics be distorted by the artificial mass querying, but the benchmark could also be negatively affected by the writing speed of your SD card. Logging can be disabled using sudo pihole logging off . The long-term database can be disabled by setting DBFILE= in /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf and running sudo pihole restartdns (see also here ). 2.2 Increase DNS cache size \u00b6 We also suggest increasing the DNS cache for benchmarking. The rather low value is fine for typical use cases. Domains will expire at some point and make room for new domains. As the benchmark will artificially increase the querying rate, there will be no time for the domains to expire naturally. This would dramatically hit the caching performance while you would never see such performance penalties in real use cases. Set cache-size to a rather high value (maybe 25,000 - by guess roughly one-eighth to one-fourth number of the domains you extracted from the database in step 1) in /etc/dnsmasq.d/01-pihole.conf and run sudo pihole restartdns afterward. 3.

With standard DNS, requests are sent in plain-text, with no method to detect tampering or misbehavior. This means that not only can a malicious actor look at all the DNS requests you are making (and therefore what websites you are visiting), they can also tamper with the response and redirect your device to resources in their control (such as a fake login page for internet banking). DNS-Over-HTTPS prevents this by using standard HTTPS requests to retrieve DNS information. This means that the connection from the device to the DNS server is secure and can not easily be snooped, monitored, tampered with or blocked.

After applying the blocking lists, it forwards requests made by the clients to configured upstream DNS server(s). However, as has been mentioned by several users in the past, this leads to some privacy concerns as it ultimately raises the question: Whom can you trust? Recently, more and more small (and not so small) DNS upstream providers have appeared on the market, advertising free and private DNS service, but how can you know that they keep their promises? Right, you can't. Furthermore, from the point of an attacker, the DNS servers of larger providers are very worthwhile targets, as they only need to poison one DNS server, but millions of users might be affected. Instead of your bank's actual IP address, you could be sent to a phishing site hosted on some island. This scenario has already happened and it isn't unlikely to happen again... When you operate your own (tiny) recursive DNS server, then the likeliness of getting affected by such an attack is greatly reduced. What is a recursive DNS server? \u00b6 The first distinction we have to be aware of is whether a DNS server is authoritative or not. If I'm the authoritative server for, e.g., pi-hole.net , then I know which IP is the correct answer for a query. Recursive name servers, in contrast, resolve any query they receive by consulting the servers authoritative for this query by traversing the domain. Example: We want to resolve pi-hole.net . On behalf of the client, the recursive DNS server will traverse the path of the domain across the Internet to deliver the answer to the question. What does this guide provide? \u00b6 In only a few simple steps, we will describe how to set up your own recursive DNS server. It will run on the same device you're already using for your Pi-hole. There are no additional hardware requirements. This guide assumes a fairly recent Debian/Ubuntu-based system and will use the maintainer provided packages for installation to make it an incredibly simple process. It assumes only a very basic knowledge of how DNS work. A standard Pi-hole installation will do it as follows: Your client asks the Pi-hole Who is pi-hole.net ? Your Pi-hole will check its cache and reply if the answer is already known. Your Pi-hole will check the blocking lists and reply if the domain is blocked. Since neither 2. nor 3. is true in our example, the Pi-hole forwards the request to the configured external upstream DNS server(s). Upon receiving the answer, your Pi-hole will reply to your client and tell it the answer to its request. Lastly, your Pi-hole will save the answer in its cache to be able to respond faster if any of your clients queries the same domain again. After you set up your Pi-hole as described in this guide, this procedure changes notably: Your client asks the Pi-hole Who is pi-hole.net ? Your Pi-hole will check its cache and reply if the answer is already known. Your Pi-hole will check the blocking lists and reply if the domain is blocked. Since neither 2. nor 3. is true in our example, the Pi-hole delegates the request to the (local) recursive DNS resolver. Your recursive server will send a query to the DNS root servers: \"Who is handling .net ?\" The root server answers with a referral to the TLD servers for .net . Your recursive server will send a query to one of the TLD DNS servers for .net : \"Who is handling pi-hole.net ?\" The TLD server answers with a referral to the authoritative name servers for pi-hole.net . Your recursive server will send a query to the authoritative name servers: \"What is the IP of pi-hole.net ?\" The authoritative server will answer with the IP address of the domain pi-hole.net . Your recursive server will send the reply to your Pi-hole which will, in turn, reply to your client and tell it the answer to its request. Lastly, your Pi-hole will save the answer in its cache to be able to respond faster if any of your clients queries the same domain again. You can easily imagine even longer chains for subdomains as the query process continues until your recursive resolver reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name. It is obvious that the methods are very different and the own recursion is more involved than \"just\" asking some upstream server. This has benefits and drawbacks: Benefit: Privacy - as you're directly contacting the responsive servers, no server can fully log the exact paths you're going, as e.g. the Google DNS servers will only be asked if you want to visit a Google website, but not if you visit the website of your favorite newspaper, etc. Drawback: Traversing the path may be slow, especially for the first time you visit a website - while the bigger DNS providers always have answers for commonly used domains in their cache, you will have to transverse the path if you visit a page for the first time. The first request to a formerly unknown TLD may take up to a second (or even more if you're also using DNSSEC). Subsequent requests to domains under the same TLD usually complete in < 0.1s . Fortunately, both your Pi-hole as well as your recursive server will be configured for efficient caching to minimize the number of queries that will actually have to be performed. Setting up Pi-hole as a recursive DNS server solution \u00b6 We will use unbound , a secure open-source recursive DNS server primarily developed by NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc., Nominet, and Kirei.

After applying the blocking lists, it forwards requests made by the clients to configured upstream DNS server(s). However, as has been mentioned by several users in the past, this leads to some privacy concerns as it ultimately raises the question: Whom can you trust? Recently, more and more small (and not so small) DNS upstream providers have appeared on the market, advertising free and private DNS service, but how can you know that they keep their promises? Right, you can't. Furthermore, from the point of an attacker, the DNS servers of larger providers are very worthwhile targets, as they only need to poison one DNS server, but millions of users might be affected. Instead of your bank's actual IP address, you could be sent to a phishing site hosted on some island. This scenario has already happened and it isn't unlikely to happen again... When you operate your own (tiny) recursive DNS server, then the likeliness of getting affected by such an attack is greatly reduced.","title":"The problem: Whom can you trust?"},{"location":"guides/unbound/#what-is-a-recursive-dns-server","text":"The first distinction we have to be aware of is whether a DNS server is authoritative or not. If I'm the authoritative server for, e.g., pi-hole.net , then I know which IP is the correct answer for a query. Recursive name servers, in contrast, resolve any query they receive by consulting the servers authoritative for this query by traversing the domain. Example: We want to resolve pi-hole.net . On behalf of the client, the recursive DNS server will traverse the path of the domain across the Internet to deliver the answer to the question.","title":"What is a recursive DNS server?"},{"location":"guides/unbound/#what-does-this-guide-provide","text":"In only a few simple steps, we will describe how to set up your own recursive DNS server. It will run on the same device you're already using for your Pi-hole. There are no additional hardware requirements. This guide assumes a fairly recent Debian/Ubuntu-based system and will use the maintainer provided packages for installation to make it an incredibly simple process. It assumes only a very basic knowledge of how DNS work. A standard Pi-hole installation will do it as follows: Your client asks the Pi-hole Who is pi-hole.net ? Your Pi-hole will check its cache and reply if the answer is already known. Your Pi-hole will check the blocking lists and reply if the domain is blocked. Since neither 2. nor 3. is true in our example, the Pi-hole forwards the request to the configured external upstream DNS server(s). Upon receiving the answer, your Pi-hole will reply to your client and tell it the answer to its request. Lastly, your Pi-hole will save the answer in its cache to be able to respond faster if any of your clients queries the same domain again. After you set up your Pi-hole as described in this guide, this procedure changes notably: Your client asks the Pi-hole Who is pi-hole.net ? Your Pi-hole will check its cache and reply if the answer is already known. Your Pi-hole will check the blocking lists and reply if the domain is blocked. Since neither 2. nor 3. is true in our example, the Pi-hole delegates the request to the (local) recursive DNS resolver. Your recursive server will send a query to the DNS root servers: \"Who is handling .net ?\" The root server answers with a referral to the TLD servers for .net . Your recursive server will send a query to one of the TLD DNS servers for .net : \"Who is handling pi-hole.net ?\" The TLD server answers with a referral to the authoritative name servers for pi-hole.net . Your recursive server will send a query to the authoritative name servers: \"What is the IP of pi-hole.net ?\" The authoritative server will answer with the IP address of the domain pi-hole.net . Your recursive server will send the reply to your Pi-hole which will, in turn, reply to your client and tell it the answer to its request. Lastly, your Pi-hole will save the answer in its cache to be able to respond faster if any of your clients queries the same domain again. You can easily imagine even longer chains for subdomains as the query process continues until your recursive resolver reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name. It is obvious that the methods are very different and the own recursion is more involved than \"just\" asking some upstream server. This has benefits and drawbacks: Benefit: Privacy - as you're directly contacting the responsive servers, no server can fully log the exact paths you're going, as e.g. the Google DNS servers will only be asked if you want to visit a Google website, but not if you visit the website of your favorite newspaper, etc. Drawback: Traversing the path may be slow, especially for the first time you visit a website - while the bigger DNS providers always have answers for commonly used domains in their cache, you will have to transverse the path if you visit a page for the first time. The first request to a formerly unknown TLD may take up to a second (or even more if you're also using DNSSEC). Subsequent requests to domains under the same TLD usually complete in < 0.1s . Fortunately, both your Pi-hole as well as your recursive server will be configured for efficient caching to minimize the number of queries that will actually have to be performed.","title":"What does this guide provide?"},{"location":"guides/unbound/#setting-up-pi-hole-as-a-recursive-dns-server-solution","text":"We will use unbound , a secure open-source recursive DNS server primarily developed by NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc., Nominet, and Kirei.

If you're in a recent Browser and only visit encrypted (HTTPS) sites, that isn't too bad, since the Browser would warn you with an invalid certificate warning (unless someone would hack a Certificate authority or get a CA to issue a certificate without validation - which is both highly unlikely ). But other apps on your network that resolve DNS queries via DNS over Tor might either communicate unencrypted or don't validate certificates properly. Such apps could get malicious data injected and/or phish your data without your knowledge. So, ideally, only use DNS over Tor if you know for a fact that the apps in your network communicate over a secure connection and properly validate certificates. That being said, if you use DNS over Tor in the default configuration (meaning no custom ExitNodes in the torrc), this kind of attack requires a big portion of luck for the attacker (owner of a Bad Exit Node), because you would have to get a circuit routing over the Bad Exit Node in the same moment when using an insecure app (Tor switches the circuit at least every 10minutes in the default configuration). On top of that, an attacker must first find an app that has this kind of vulnerability and has valuable data or attack vectors. This is unlikely since most apps out there that handle sensitive data at least communicate over encrypted connections that validate certificates based on system or manual root certs. To lower the chances of Bad Exit Nodes you could restrict ExitNodes to trusted ones ( country and/or specific ). Choosing specific Exit Nodes would basically be the same as e.g. trusting specific DNSCrypt resolvers or Alternative DNS Servers . They might be good, they might be bad, you can't know for sure (unless the DNS answers are DNSSEC signed - but that's most likely not the case for the kinds of app that might get affected by this). So, in the end, it boils down to one of the following use cases. Encrypt your DNS traffic using Tor so your ISP can't collect it (but still is able to collect what Websites/IPs you visit unless you route that traffic also over Tor) and the DNS Server won't see your real IP for the price of maybe getting a Bad Exit Node that fakes answers to DNS queries. Use DNSCrypt so your ISP can't collect DNS traffic (but still can collect the websites/IPs you visit unless you route that traffic over Tor), but you have to accept that the DNSCrypt resolver you've chosen might store your DNS queries together with your IP (unless you modify DNSCrypt to route over Tor ) and could also turn out to send faked answers to DNS queries. I guess you would call that a Bad DNSCrypt resolver then. Use an unencrypted alternative DNS server (there are a lot of lists out there). In this case, your ISP easily can record your DNS traffic and the alternative DNS server can store your DNS queries together with your IP. On top of that, your ISP or the alternative DNS could also fake the answer to the DNS queries. That would be a Bad Alternative DNS Server then. Use your ISP DNS server. In this case, your ISP gets your DNS traffic for free. On top of that, the ISP could also fake answers to DNS queries. Bad ISP DNS Server. The bottom line is that you have to weigh up who you trust the most and which risks you are willing to take.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"guides/tor/overview/#contribute-to-the-tor-project","text":"If you got spare resources, consider running a Tor Relay (or Exit ) Node to contribute back to the Tor Network.

In this case, you have to wait a few minutes until you switch to another Tor circuit or configure Tor to accept control connections and send a command that tells Tor to switch circuits immediately . You could set ExitNodes in your torrc to a specific set of Exit nodes that are reliable for you or use only Exit nodes in a specific country (on Debian derivatives you need to have the tor-geoipdb package installed for that to work) and thus avoid problems with DNS lookups to some extent. Keep in mind that this approach increases the correlation attack vulnerability if you only have a small amount of ExitNodes set or your selected country/s has/have few Exit nodes. If your goal is only to slightly increase security and maintain performance and reliability, this approach might be for you. It is not recommended. Ok, but please just tell me how to avoid timeouts So you've read about Performance, Reliability and Timeouts and just want a quick solution. This is not recommended, but here are some things you can do: Solution 1 - Only use Exit Nodes from specific countries \u00b6 Install the necessary geoip db for Tor to use, on Debian derivatives (Raspbian, Ubuntu) that means sudo apt install tor-geoipdb Pick the Country Codes you want to use as ExitNodes from the \"List of country codes for Tor\" list on this page . Edit /etc/tor/torrc as root and, add the following lines to the end and replace CountryCodeN (keep the { and } ) with the country code you've chosen (you can also use only one country code; in this case, it would be just {CountryCode1} without a comma). ExitNodes {CountryCode1},{CountryCode2},{CountryCode3} StrictNodes 1 Save the changes, restart Tor sudo service tor restart Note: Using this approach you put a strain on Tor Relays in the selected countries only and increase your security vulnerability. It's not nice and not recommended. Also, be aware that this change also affects which Exit Nodes are used if you Route Your Browser Traffic over the Pi-hole host Tor SocksPort. Solution 2 - Only use specific Exit Nodes \u00b6 Navigate to atlas.torproject.org Top Relays . Click on two Relays out of the list. Make sure the relay allows Port 53 in his IPv4 Exit Policy Summary (and/or IPv6 Exit Policy Summary if you want to resolve IPv6 AAAA queries). As root copy the Fingerprint (Top Right under Relay Details) of those two Relays to the end of your /etc/tor/torrc file on the Pi-hole host in the following format: ExitNodes Fingerprint1,Fingerprint2 StrictNodes 1 Save the changes, restart Tor sudo service tor restart If DNS requests stop resolving at all, you might need to repeat this procedure because the Relays you chose might've gone down. Note: Using this approach you put a strain on single Tor Relays and increase your security vulnerability. It's not nice and not recommended. Also, be aware that this change also affects which Exit Nodes are used if you Route Your Browser Traffic over the Pi-hole host Tor SocksPort. Hint: You can combine both Solutions and have country codes and fingerprints as ExitNodes . IPv6 \u00b6 DNS over Tor only partially supports IPv6 as of now. This is only a problem if your Router or your ISP don't support IPv4 or you want only IPv6 traffic for another reason - if you have both IPv4 and IPv6 available and you don't plan to visit an IPv6 only service, this is no problem at all. In general, if you made sure that you configured your Pi-hole to support IPv6 , resolving IPv6 addresses will sometimes work and sometimes not. The reason for this is that Tor Exit nodes only resolve IPv6 queries if they have IPv6Exit 1 set in their configuration. Tor is working on a fix for that - but until that is done and the Tor exit nodes switched to the fixed version, you will run into situations where IPv6 addresses aren't resolvable despite being available in the responsible nameserver. To check whether your current Exit node resolves IPv6 correctly you can run dig example.com aaaa (Linux) or nslookup -q=aaaa example.com (Windows) on your client. If you're dependent on IPv6 and can't use IPv4 at all, your only chance is to configure ExitNodes in your torrc to only point to Exit nodes that resolve IPv6 correctly. But keep in mind that this approach increases the correlation attack vulnerability if you only have a small amount of ExitNodes set. Also, you can't (AFAIK) change the internal IPv4 Tor DNS address on the Pi-hole host to an IPv6 one since DNSPort doesn't support that - so you need at least internal IPv4 on your Pi-hole host, which is the default on most host systems. Exit node fingerprints \u00b6 To get the fingerprint of your current Exit node, you can configure SocksPort 0.0.0.0:9050 in your torrc, restart tor, point your browser to use your Pi-hole's IP and port 9050 as Socks5 proxy, visit e.g. check.torproject.org to get your Exit Node IP, search for that IP on atlas.torproject.org , click on one of the results and it will show the Fingerprint top right under details. These fingerprints can be set as a comma-separated value for ExitNodes . Don't forget to remove the SocksPort option and restart tor if you don't need it anymore. Also, it should be noted that the Exit node you get over SocksPort is not necessarily the same as the one you get when issuing DNS requests over the DNSPort since Tor internally keeps multiple circuits open.

One server routes the normal user traffic and the second routes only DNS requests. This can be done with two OpenVPN configurations. Prerequisites and Configuration \u00b6 You should have an existing OpenVPN server configured and running. We are going to use the original configuration file located at /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf . First, copy the file: sudo cp /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf /etc/openvpn/server/server2.conf Next, exit the new copy of the configuration. We use the nano editor in this example, but any editor will work. Remember to edit under the root account via sudo . sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server/server2.conf We will need to change the port to one different from the original so that it does not conflict with the first instance of OpenVPN. Assuming you used the default port configuration, you should have 1194 as the port. You need to change this to a different value, making sure the port is available - 1195 should be. Next, if needed, port forward the newly configured port from your router to your device. You will also need to assign a different class of IP addresses that will serve this connection only. Your server line should look like this: server 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.0 Make sure that the DNS requests go through the instance of OpenVPN: push \"dhcp-option DNS 10.9.0.1\" One other setting that we need to change is to comment out the bypass-dhcp instruction so that it looks like: # push \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\"`. Commenting out this line ensures that no traffic is routed via the VPN server. Save the file and start the second instance of OpenVPN: systemctl start openvpn@server2.service If your distribution does not have systemctl you may use the command below to start an OpenVPN daemon with your second configuration: /usr/sbin/openvpn --daemon --writepid /var/run/openvpn/server2.pid --cd /etc/openvpn --config server2.conf --script-security 2 Finally, edit the existing .ovpn file used for the client connection.

This section is aimed at a server set up in a private network like on a Raspberry Pi. So if blocking works using eth0 but stops working for tun0 , as described here , you may want to run this command pihole -a -i all , which should get the behavior you want by opening dnsmasq up to listen on all ports. This is not recommended for cloud servers as they should not be listening on eth0 . If you want to set up your Pi-hole + OpenVPN such that you can use from both internal ((W)LAN) and external (VPN) networks, you have to apply some small changes. As an additional benefit, you will be able to reach all devices in the internal network (e.g. computers, networking-aware printers, etc.) through the VPN. This setup assumes that your local network is in the range 192.168.2.0 (i.e. device addresses are in the range of 192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2.254). If this is not the case for you, you have to adjust the settings, accordingly, e.g. devices in 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.254 -> route 192.168.0.0 devices in 192.168.123.1 - 192.168.123.254 -> route 192.168.123.0 Edit your /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf : push \"route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0\" push \"dhcp-option DNS 192.168.2.123\" As you can see, we change the address of the DNS server to the local IP address of our Pi-hole (which is 192.168.2.123 in this example). Afterward, we change the interface of Pi-hole to eth0 (your local network adapter instead of the VPN adapter tun0 ). This can conveniently be done by using pihole -r + Reconfigure . After a restart of the OpenVPN server, all clients should be able to see all devices within your (at home) local network. This is an example running on a distant server, which is connected through the VPN and can successfully communicate with all internal devices: me@client ~ $ ifconfig eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr e0:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx inet addr:134.x.x.x Bcast:134.x.x.x Mask:255.x.x.x inet6 addr: X:X:X:X::X/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:3623911 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:2803670 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:1921375471 ( 1 .9 GB ) TX bytes:1227835028 ( 1 .2 GB ) lo Link encap:Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:65536 Metric:1 RX packets:553426 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:553426 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1 RX bytes:113417383 ( 113 .4 MB ) TX bytes:113417383 ( 113 .4 MB ) tun0 Link encap:UNSPEC HWaddr 00 -00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 inet addr:10.8.0.2 P-t-P:10.8.0.2 Mask:255.255.255.0 UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:274676 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:331178 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 RX bytes:43745313 ( 43 .7 MB ) TX bytes:43956250 ( 43 .9 MB ) me@client ~ $ ping 192 .168.2.123 PING 192 .168.2.123 ( 192 .168.2.123 ) 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 192 .168.2.123: icmp_seq = 1 ttl = 64 time = 18 .9 ms 64 bytes from 192 .168.2.123: icmp_seq = 2 ttl = 64 time = 18 .9 ms 64 bytes from 192 .168.2.123: icmp_seq = 3 ttl = 64 time = 18 .9 ms 64 bytes from 192 .168.2.123: icmp_seq = 4 ttl = 64 time = 18 .7 ms 64 bytes from 192 .168.2.123: icmp_seq = 5 ttl = 64 time = 18 .7 ms 64 bytes from 192 .168.2.123: icmp_seq = 6 ttl = 64 time = 19 .0 ms ^C --- 192 .168.2.123 ping statistics --- 6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0 % packet loss, time 5007ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 18 .740/18.894/19.017/0.189 ms Important last step \u00b6 The undocumented pihole -a -i all command is simply what runs when you choose Listen on all interfaces, permit all origins (make sure your Pi-hole is firewalled) , which if you've read this far in the tutorial, you should understand that we don't want you to knowingly or unknowing set up an open resolver.","title":"Optional: Dual operation: LAN & VPN at the same time"},{"location":"guides/vpn/dual-operation/#important-last-step","text":"The undocumented pihole -a -i all command is simply what runs when you choose Listen on all interfaces, permit all origins (make sure your Pi-hole is firewalled) , which if you've read this far in the tutorial, you should understand that we don't want you to knowingly or unknowing set up an open resolver.","title":"Important last step"},{"location":"guides/vpn/dynDNS/","text":"If you operate your Pi-hole + OpenVPN at home, you are likely sitting behind a NAT / dynamically changing IP address.

Setting up a DNS server has become a simple task with Pi-hole's automated installer, which has resulted in many people knowingly--or unknowingly--creating an open resolver, which aids in DNS Amplification Attacks. We do not encourage open resolvers but there are always people wanting access to their ad-blocking capabilities outside of their home network, whether it's on their cellular network or on an unsecured wireless network.

Any hardware that runs one of the supported operating systems will do! Supported Operating Systems \u00b6 The following operating systems are officially supported: Distribution Release Architecture Raspbian Stretch / Buster ARM Ubuntu 16.x / 18.x ARM / x86_64 Debian 9 / 10 ARM / x86_64 / i386 Fedora 28 / 29 ARM / x86_64 CentOS 7 x86_64 IP Addressing \u00b6 Pi-hole needs a static IP address to properly function (a DHCP reservation is just fine). Users may run into issues because we currently install dhcpcd5 , which may conflict with other running network managers such as dhclient , dhcpcd , networkmanager , and systemd-networkd . As part of our install process, we append some lines to /etc/dhcpcd.conf in order to statically assign an IP address , so take note of this before installing. Please be aware of this fact because it may cause confusion . This is not the ideal situation for us to be in but, since a significant portion of our users are running Pi-hole on Raspbian - and because Pi-hole's roots began with the Raspberry Pi - it's a problem that is difficult to get away from . Due to the complexity of different ways of setting an IP address across different systems, it's a slow process and we need help . If you're willing to contribute, please let us know. Ports \u00b6 Service Port Protocol Notes dnsmasq 53 ( DNS ) TCP / UDP If you happen to have another DNS server running, such as BIND, you will need to turn it off in order for Pi-hole to respond to DNS queries. dnsmasq 67 ( DHCP ) IPv4 UDP The DHCP server is an optional feature that requires additional ports. dnsmasq 547 ( DHCPv6 ) IPv6 UDP The DHCP server is an optional feature that requires additional ports. lighttpd 80 ( HTTP ) TCP If you have another Web server already running, such as Apache, Pi-hole's Web server will not work. You can either disable the other Web server or change the port on which lighttpd listens, which allows you keep both Web servers running. pihole- FTL 4711-4720 TCP FTL is our API engine and uses port 4711 on the localhost interface. This port should not be accessible from any other interface. Info The use of lighttpd on port 80 is optional if you decide not to install the Web dashboard during installation. The use of dnsmasq on ports 67 or 547 is optional, but required if you use the DHCP functions of Pi-hole. Firewalls \u00b6 Below are some examples of firewall rules that will need to be set on your Pi-hole server in order to use the functions available. These are only shown as guides, the actual commands used will be found with your distribution's documentation. Because Pi-hole was designed to work inside a local network, the following rules will block the traffic from the Internet for security reasons. 192.168.0.0/16 is the most common local network IP range for home users but it can be different in your case, for example other common local network IPs are 10.0.0.0/8 and 172.16.0.0/12 . Check your local network settings before applying these rules. IPTables \u00b6 IPTables uses two sets of tables. One set is for IPv4 chains, and the second is for IPv6 chains. If only IPv4 blocking is used for the Pi-hole installation, only apply the rules for IP4Tables. Full Stack ( IPv4 and IPv6 ) require both sets of rules to be applied. Note: These examples insert the rules at the front of the chain. Please see your distribution's documentation for the exact proper command to use.
